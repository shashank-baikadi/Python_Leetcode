# Python_Leetcode 
python is dynamically typed langauage ........datatype is deceided while run time
## Array
Array- collection of similar type of data like if one is integer  rest of the object will be integer general perspective its is not growable ...length of the array is fixed 

2) we can store only homogenious values in array where as in listg u can store hetrogenous value

3) in array class we will have many function 
appemd()
count()
extend() 
insert()
remove() in remove we have to mention value 
reverse()
tolist()
pop() in pop we will mention index

difference btw array and dyanamic array
array:
fixed size
indexed
collection of same type elements

dynamic array:
collection of diiferent type element
resizable
indexed

## List
fromlist--- we can  make list to array
tolist-----we can make array to list

list is predefined class its in buildins data structure  ,its also elementaray datatype provide by python

2) list is growable

3) mutable eg at certain index we can add or remove that type of thing

4) list is also called as dynamic array
